<div id="aone"><p>You receive no prayers now, no offerings, and the silence that was once welcome relief has turned to loneliness, a vacuum of purpose, a dry sense of inadequacy. Such feelings must come, you expect, to all the lesser gods.</p>
<p>In an age of peace, you are the god of women who fight among the stars; in a time of bioengineering, you are the god of six little-used alloys. Out here in the vacuum of space or among desert planets, you are the god of small orange flowers, and of birds with blue on their neck or breast. In an era where neuro-implants can override any cognitive impairment, you are the god of those who numbers slide away from when they are added or subtracted.</p>
<p>You long to be, not a god of love or death or time or peace; you do not envy the lives of your great grandparents or first cousins once removed. No, you long to be a god of the blue-grey dust that falls grain by grain as waves of wind pummel the mountain sides. A god of red eyed lizards, of electrical currents on wires made of a single strand of nerve cells. You could be a god of anti-corrosion paint, of interplanetary navigation systems, of quintuplets and of fictitious excuses for absences from work. You donâ€™t have to be big, or important; you just want to mean something to people again.</p></div>
