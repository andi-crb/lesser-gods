          <p>You receive no prayers now, no offerings, and the silence that was once welcome relief has turned to loneliness, a vacuum of purpose, a dry sense of inadequacy. Such feelings must come, you expect, to all the lesser gods.</p>
          <p>In an age of peace, you are the god of women who fight among the stars; in a time of bioengineering, you are the god of six little-used alloys. Out here in the vacuum of space or among desert planets, you are the god of small orange flowers, and of birds with blue on their neck or breast. In an era where neuro-implants can override any cognitive impairment, you are the god of those who numbers slide away from when they are added or subtracted.</p>
          <p>You long to be, not a god of love or death or time or peace; you do not envy the lives of your great grandparents or first cousins once removed. No, you long to be a god of the blue-grey dust that falls grain by grain as waves of wind pummel the mountain sides. A god of red eyed lizards, of electrical currents on wires made of a single strand of nerve cells. You could be a god of anti-corrosion paint, of interplanetary navigation systems, of quintuplets and of fictitious excuses for absences from work. You don’t have to be big, or important; you just want to mean something to people again.</p>
          <p>You are not the first of the lesser gods to have faced this predicament. You know there are options. You can [[live among the people for a time]]. You can learn their ways, gently guide them to your worship. Or you can try and [[become something new]].</p>

          <p>You never set out to fall in love with anyone. If pressed, you’d say you loved salt, and that was enough for anyone.</p>
          <p>People might think you like salt because it is your livelihood, because it paid for your tiny craft, and even after the loan on that is paid you have enough for maintenance and fuel and a meal and a show at every stop. They might think you like salt because it takes you across the galaxy, to the feet of mountains and to distance green seas. They are not wrong, but your love of salt is more instinctual, started long before any of these things were a possibility.</p>
          <p>As a child, so long ago on that cold, dry planet, you would seek out salt whenever you could, cram handfuls into your mouth, delighting in the taste, the texture as it dissolves. Even when they diagnosed, then treated, the rare source of your craving, you still looked for salt, letting it trickle through your fingers. </p>
          <p>Look in a mirror, or turn your camera so your face fills the screen. How old do you look? Thirty, perhaps forty? But you’ve spent your life stringing yourself out among the stars, and time works differently out here.</p>
          <p>The last time you visited the planet you were born on, it had been more than a hundred years since your birth and your grandparents, more than two hundred years old, were wrinkled and – though no-one said it – dying. Next time, it will be your parents.</p>
          <p>This journey takes you closer to your home than you’ve been in a long time. You could [[go back]]. It might be easier [[not to]], though, and just stick with your memories.</p>
